## Vue.js

- Vuejsis a JavaScript **FRAMEWORK** used for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications (SPAs). It is designed to be incrementally adaptable and can be easily integrated into other projects.

### Why Vue.js?

#### Ease of Learning

- VueJs is known for its simplicity and ease of learning, making it a great choice for beginners in web development.

#### Flexibility

- Vues is designed to be incrementally adaptable. You can use as much or as
  little of it as you need in your project.

#### Component-Based Architecture

- Vues promotes a component-based architecture, which is a widely adopted
  and efficient way to build user interfaces.

#### Reactivity

- Vues provides a reactive data-binding system, simplifying the process of
  keeping the Ul in sync with the application state.

#### Growing Ecosystem

- Vue.js has a growing ecosystem of libraries, tools, and plugins developed by the community.

#### Performance

Vues is designed with performance in mind. Its reactivity system and virtual
DOM help optimize rendering, making it suitable for building efficient and
fast applications.

#### Job Opportunities

As Vue js gains popularity, the demand for developers with Vue.js skills is
increasing. Learning Vue.js can enhance your job prospects, especially if
you're interested in working on modern web development projects.

#### Integration with Other Technologies

Vue js can be easily integrated with other libraries and frameworks. For
example, you can use Vue.js alongside Vuex for state management or Vue
Router for routing.

### What Is Component?

- A component is a reusable and self-contained unit that encapsulates a
  specific piece of functionality or user interface. Components are a
  fundamental building block of Vue applications, and they allow you to
  organize and structure your code in a modular way.

#### Why Components?

##### Modularity

- Components allow you to break down your application into smaller, reusable
  pieces. Each component is responsible for a specific feature or functionality,
  making it easier to understand and maintain your code.

##### Reusability

- Components can be reused across different parts of your application or even
  in multiple projects. This reusability reduces redundancy in your code and
  speeds up development.

##### Maintainability

- With components, it's easier to manage and maintain your codebase. Each
  component is a self-contained unit with its own functionality, making it
  simpler to troubleshoot and update.

### Text Interpolation {{}}

- Text interpolation in refers to the process of dynamically `binding data` to the content of an HTML element in your template. It allows you to display the value of a JavaScript expression or a variable within the markup.

```javascript
syntax;
{
  {
    data;
  }
}
```

#### Attribute Bindings :

Attribute binding is a way to bind HTML `attributes` to data in Vue instance.

- old Way

  - v-bind:attr

- new way
  - :attr
